1.
In adaptive threshold, the algorithm calculate the threshold for a small regions of the image. 

The band threshold take the upper band and lower band, which only shows limited range of color
scalar of the images.

The binary threshold only shows black and white by deviding equally the range of colors.

The semi threshold takes the extreme value from the high value and low value.

2. The output results are too simple, which may not be apllied to some complicated cases.

3.Adaptive threshold is better for using images with varying illumination
